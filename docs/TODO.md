In testing:

We're not testing actual audio processing or API calls, but rather ensuring our functions handle the responses correctly.
We're not testing every possible input or error case. In a more comprehensive test suite, you'd want to add tests for error handling, edge cases, etc.
Testing for all format files.
Audio to text, audio to audio taking tomuch time
