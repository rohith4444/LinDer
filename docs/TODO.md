# TODO List

- [ ] Improve error handling for entire project
- [ ] Add support for more languages
- [ ] Handling long running tasks
when the source language and target language is same we have to write a new prompt translate properly
Logging:
Consider adding a logging system instead of using print statements for errors. This would make debugging easier in the long run.
Configuration:
Consider moving configuration variables (like API keys, language options, etc.) to a separate configuration file.
